# GrubDash

Project Prompt:
You've been hired as a backend developer for a new startup called GrubDash!
As another developer works on the design and frontend experience, you have been
tasked with setting up an API and building out specific routes so that the 
frontend developers can demo some initial design ideas for the big bosses.

Quick Description:
This project tests my ability to build APIs with complex validation,
using common middleware packages, receiving requests through routes,
accessing relevant information through route parameters, building an API following RESTful design principles,
and writing custom middleware functions.
